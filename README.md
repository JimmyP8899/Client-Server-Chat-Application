# Client-Server Chat Application

The client server chat application is a networking project that allows up to 10 clients to connect to a server and communicate with each other. The server has the ability to accept messages from clients and broadcast the messages to the rest of the clients. Clients are able to connect and disconnect from the server hosting the application and send messages to the server as well. The project also includes basic authentication measures, such as allowing users to authenticate with a username and password.
